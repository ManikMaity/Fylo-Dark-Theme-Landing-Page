# Fylo-Dark-Theme-Landing-Page
Fylo dark theme landing page is the fronendmentor challenge website which I coded after my sem - 4 exam break to hone my html and CSS skills and this is the last website I build only using HTML and pure CSS. I am going to learn Tailwind and will be making projects using that.
